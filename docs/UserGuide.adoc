== Introduction

Welcome to the _MediTabs User Guide_. You can find step by step instructions on how to set up MediTabs and take advantage of the features provided by MediTabs to optimise your clinic's medicine stock taking workflow. Interested? You can jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

=== What is MediTabs?

MediTabs is a desktop application for managing medicine stock taking. You can use MediTabs in your clinics to easily keep track of your medicine inventory and take note of important information such as which medicines are low in stock, expiring soon or have expired.

MediTabs supports Windows, Linux and MacOS operating systems.

=== Who is it for?

If you are looking for a medicine stock taking application for clinics, MediTabs is the product you are looking for. Whether you are an owner of a clinic or a pharmacist in charge of your clinic's medicine inventory, you can use MediTabs to help improve your workflow. It is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MediTabs can get your medicine stock taking done faster than traditional GUI apps.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` installed on your computer.
.  Download the latest version of `meditabs.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the `meditabs.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your MediTabs application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

=== Exporting as CSV file format : `export`

You can export the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI as Comma-separated values (CSV) file format which is supported by many commonly used spreadsheet applications such as Microsoft Excel (Windows), LibreOffice (Linux) or Numbers (MacOS).

This feature is especially useful if you want to save the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI in a file so that it can be printed later or if you want to organise the medicine inventory data using a spreadsheet application for you, your superior or your supplier's reference.

In addition, you can even use the spreadsheet application to convert the CSV file to Microsoft Excel format and use all the functionalities provided by Microsoft Excel such as drawing graphs or chart to display the overview of your clinic's medicine inventory. +
Format: `export [FILE_NAME]`

****
* The `FILE_NAME` field is optional. You can refer to <<Appendix A: File Naming Convention>> for supported file name format if you want to specify a file name for the exported CSV file.
* If no file name is specified, the export command uses the default file name format according to the date and time of export.
* The specific data and time format used if no file name is specified is `dd_MMM_yyyy_HH_mm_ss` e.g. `18_Mar_2019_10_28_00`
* The file extension for a CSV file is `.csv`
* The exported file can be found in the default `exported` folder which can be found in the home folder used for your MediTabs application.
* If the default `exported` folder is not found in the home folder, MediTabs will automatically create the folder when the export command is executed.
****

Examples:

* `export` +
Exports the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI to a CSV file which has a default file name format `{Date of export}_{Time of export}`. e.g. `18_Mar_2019_10_28_00`
* `export example` +
Exports the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI to a CSV file which has the filename `example`.

[WARNING]
If a file with the specified file name already exists in the default `exported` folder, the file would not be exported and an error message `"Could not export data to csv file: {Specified File Name} already exists in "exported" directory"`

A sample image of how the medicine inventory data in the exported CSV file is organised:

image::SampleCSVFileImage.png[width="790"]

[NOTE]
From the image above, you can observe that different batches of the same medicine have their own row in the CSV file. This provides more detailed information on the quantity and expiry date for each batch of the same medicine as different batches of the same medicine can have different expiry dates and quantity. Furthermore, the CSV file also includes information such as which medicines are low in stock, expiring soon or have expired for easier reference.

[IMPORTANT]
You would observe that medicines without any batches are not included in the exported CSV file though they might be present in the current medicine inventory data shown in the GUI. This is by design, as our team believes that the exported CSV file should provide *useful detailed information*. Medicines without any batches would not have any useful information such as the quantity and expiry dates which are important when it comes to keeping track of your medicine inventory.

=== Printing labels : `label`

You can label any specific medicine information in the inventory using the Portable Document Format (PDF). +
Open the PDF file under the PDF folder to view and print your selected medicine +
Label will include name of medicine and standard label template. +
This includes the company that manufactured it, expiry date and the tags that was set with it. +
Format: `label INDEX [f/FILE_NAME]`

****
* Outputs the label for the medicine at the specified INDEX.
* If no file name is specified, the default file name is `to_print`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed medicine list.
* The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …
* All files output can be found under the PDF folder.
****

Examples:

* `list` +
`label 2` +
This will allow you to select the 2nd medicine in the inventory and output the information to a default file named `to_print`.
+
image::label2_taken.png[width="790"]
+
- A confirmation message will be shown to indicate to you that it have been successfully labeled.
+
* You can open the file in the PDF folder with your preferred PDF reader to print the medicine information.
+
image::label2.png[width="790"]
+
* `find Simvastatin` +
`label 1 f/Simvastatin` +
Similar to the example above, the 1st medicine information will be output to a file name `Simvastatin`.
+
image::label1.png[width="790"]
+
[WARNING]
The `label` command will overwrite the `to_print` file every time it is used without specifying a file name. Hence, do print the required file first before using the `label` command again. This extends to all other existing file names.

=== Listing entered commands : `history`

Lists all the commands that you have entered in reverse chronological order. +
Format: `history`

[NOTE]
====
Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows will display the previous and next input respectively in the command box.
====

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undoing previous command : `undo`

Restores the inventory to the state before the previous _undoable_ command was executed. +
Format: `undo`

[NOTE]
====
Undoable commands: those commands that modify the inventry's content (`add`, `delete`, `edit`, `update` and `clear`).
====

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`list` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

* `select 1` +
`list` +
`undo` +
The `undo` command fails as there are no undoable commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +

=== Redoing the previously undone command : `redo`

Reverses the most recent `undo` command. +
Format: `redo`

Examples:

* `delete 1` +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +

* `delete 1` +
`redo` +
The `redo` command fails as there are no `undo` commands executed previously.

* `delete 1` +
`clear` +
`undo` (reverses the `clear` command) +
`undo` (reverses the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `delete 1` command) +
`redo` (reapplies the `clear` command) +
// end::undoredo[]

=== Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the inventory. +
Format: `clear`

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Suggested medicine names `[coming in v2.0]`

Pressing the kbd:[&uarr;] and kbd:[&darr;] arrows to select from the generated list of suggestions.
====

=== Integration Addon Support `[coming in v2.0]`

You can download and install integration addons created for MediTabs such as addons which allows MediTabs to integrate with different third party services which your clinic might currently be using. +
Format: `install an/NAME_OF_ADDON`

[NOTE]
Only integration addons that have been verified by our team can be downloaded and installed in MediTabs. This is to ensure that the addons downloaded and installed in MediTabs are secure and have no malicious code. This is to ensure the security which MediTabs provides would not be compromise as security is an important factor due to the increasing threat with regards to cybersecurity.

Benefits of integration addon support are as follows:

* Provides greater flexibility as your clinic might have different third party services which you might want to integrate with to allow for easier transition between services.
* Allows you to customise MediTabs with features that your clinic requires without any unnecessary features which might not be relevant to your clinic's workflow.

An example of an integration addon which would be supported by MediTabs:

* Singapore's Health Science Authority (HSA) - To integrate the Singapore HSA's medical database with MediTabs which allows easy retrieval of important information such as when a medicine is requested to be recalled by the HSA.

[NOTE]
This feature could be further expanded to support medical databases of different countries.

=== Saving the data

Inventory data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

== Appendix A: File Naming Convention

MediTabs uses the following file naming convention when file name field is used e.g. The `export` command's optional `[FILE_NAME]` field. The file naming convention is to ensure consistency and to avoid potential bugs involving file names with different operating systems such as Windows, Linux and MacOS +
Format: `Start with an alphabet or number followed by alphabets, numbers, underscore or hyphen`

[NOTE]
File name *does not* include file extension such as `.csv` and `.pdf`. You do not have to include file extension when specifying the file name field such as in `export [FILE_NAME]`. MediTabs will handle the file name extension for you.

Examples of correct and incorrect file names:
|===
|Correct |Incorrect

|`myMedicalData`
|`_myMedicalData`

|`my_Medical_Data`
|`my Medical Data`

|`myMedicalData1`
|`myMedicalData.txt`

|`1myMedicalData`
|`-MyMedicalData`
|===

[IMPORTANT]
You must follow the file naming convention format when specifying the file name field for any commands that support file name as a field.

[CAUTION]
The characters of the file name cannot contain any spacing or symbols, including but not limited to, `\/:*?"<>|.+[]{};!@#$%^&~`` Reserved names, indicated in Windows documentation, are also *not allowed* to be used as file names such as `COM1` and `LPT8`. You can read more about file naming conventions in Windows link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file#naming-conventions[here].
