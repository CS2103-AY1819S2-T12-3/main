== Introduction

MediTabs is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing medicine stock taking. This is especially useful for clinics such as family clinics or private clinics to track the amount of medicine they have left available. More importantly, MediTabs is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MediTabs can get your medicine stock taking done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `meditabs.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your MediTabs application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all medicines in inventory
* *`add`* `n/Paracetamol c/3M Pharmaceuticals` : adds a new medicine named Paracetamol to the inventory
* *`delete`* `3` : deletes the 3rd entry shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

*Terminology*

* *List:* This refers to the currently displayed list (possibly filtered).
* *Inventory:* This refers to the storage containing all medicines that have been added. Display all medicines in the inventory by using the `list` command.

*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Paracetamol`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `e.g n/NAME [t/TAG] can be used as `n/Paracetamol t/Popular` or as `n/Paracetamol`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), t/Ordered, t/PhasingOut t/SlowMoving etc..
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME c/COMPANY_NAME`, `c/COMPANY_NAME n/NAME` is also acceptable.
