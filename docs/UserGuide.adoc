== Introduction

MediTabs is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing medicine stock taking. This is especially useful for clinics such as family clinics or private clinics to track the amount of medicine they have left available. More importantly, MediTabs is optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MediTabs can get your medicine stock taking done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `meditabs.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your MediTabs application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
