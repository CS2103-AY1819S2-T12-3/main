== Introduction to MediTabs
* *MediTabs* is for those who prefer to use a desktop app for managing medicine stock taking.
* This is especially useful for clinics such as family clinics or private clinics to track the amount of medicine they have left available.

== Benefits of MediTabs
1. It is _optimized_ for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still being able to enjoy the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
2. If you can type fast, MediTabs can get your medicine stock taking done faster than traditional GUI apps.
